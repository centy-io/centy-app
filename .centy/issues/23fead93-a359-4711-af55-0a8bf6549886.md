# Remove Pull Requests feature from the app

## Summary

Remove the Pull Requests (PRs) entity and all related functionality from the Centy app. This includes the frontend pages/components, proto definitions, daemon RPC handlers, and local storage in `.centy/pull-requests/`.

## Motivation

PRs as a domain concept within Centy overlap with the pull request functionality already provided by git hosting platforms (GitHub, GitLab, etc.). Maintaining a separate PR management system adds complexity without sufficient value. Removing it simplifies the app and allows focus on the core strengths: issues and documentation.

## Scope

- Remove PR-related pages and routes (`/pull-requests`, `/pull-requests/[prNumber]`, `/pull-requests/new`)
- Remove PR components (`PRsList`, `PRDetail`, `CreatePR`, aggregate views for PRs)
- Remove PR-related proto definitions (`PullRequest`, `PrMetadata`, PR RPCs)
- Remove PR references from navigation, sidebar, and aggregate views
- Remove PR-related hooks, filters, and configuration options
- Clean up entity linking to remove PR as a linkable target
- Update any shared components that reference PRs (e.g., link sections, search)
