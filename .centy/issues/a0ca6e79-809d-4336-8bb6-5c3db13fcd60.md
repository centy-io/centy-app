# feat: add support for pinned items (docs, issues, etc.)

## Summary

Add the ability for users to pin important items — such as documents, issues, or other resources — for quick access within their workspace.

## Motivation

Users often need to frequently reference certain items (e.g., key documents, active issues, important links). Pinning allows them to surface these items prominently rather than searching or navigating through lists each time.

## Proposed Behavior

- Users can pin/unpin items (docs, issues, etc.) from their workspace
- Pinned items appear in a dedicated “Pinned” section for easy access
- Pinned state persists across sessions
- Support ordering/reordering of pinned items

## Scope

- Define the data model for pinned items (item type, reference ID, order, etc.)
- UI for displaying pinned items section
- Pin/unpin actions on supported item types
- Persistence of pinned items per workspace/user
