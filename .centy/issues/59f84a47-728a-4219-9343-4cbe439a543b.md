# Use URL query params as single source of truth for issue table filters

Currently, issue table filters (status, priority, etc.) are persisted in `localStorage` via `useIssueTableSettings.store.ts`, keyed per project path. This approach has several drawbacks: filters cannot be shared via URL, browser back/forward navigation doesn't reflect filter changes, and stale localStorage state can cause unexpected behavior.

## Goal

Replace localStorage as the filter persistence layer with URL query parameters, making the URL the single source of truth for all filter and sort state on the issues page (and any other pages that use filterable tables, e.g. aggregate issues).

## Scope

- **`useIssueTableSettings.store.ts`** — remove the localStorage store; read/write filter + sort state from/to URL search params instead.
- **`useIssueTableSettings.ts`** — update the hook to derive state from `useSearchParams()` and update the URL via `useRouter().replace()` (shallow, no history push) on every change.
- **`useIssuesTable.ts`** — no changes expected; it already consumes `sorting` and `columnFilters` from the settings hook.
- **Default state** — when query params are absent, fall back to the current defaults: `status=open,in-progress` and `sort=createdAt:desc`.
- **URL shape** — use a readable, shareable format, e.g. `/org/project/issues?status=open&status=in-progress&priority=high&sort=createdAt:desc`.
- **Aggregate issues view** (`AggregateIssuesList`) — apply the same pattern.
- **Other filterable pages** — audit remaining pages and migrate them consistently.

## Acceptance criteria

1. Changing a filter updates the URL query string without a full navigation (shallow replace).
2. Loading a URL with filter params pre-populates the table filters correctly.
3. Sharing/bookmarking a filtered URL reproduces the exact same view.
4. Browser back/forward navigates through filter history.
5. No filter state is written to or read from localStorage.
6. Default filters apply when no query params are present.
