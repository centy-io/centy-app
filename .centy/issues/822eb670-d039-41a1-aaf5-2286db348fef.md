# Add UI for creating standalone workspaces (no issue required)

Add UI components to create and manage standalone workspaces from the web/desktop app.

## Depends On

- centy-daemon: Support creating workspaces without an issue (standalone workspaces)

## Implementation

### 1. New Standalone Workspace Button

Add a ‘New Workspace’ button in the project view (similar to ‘New Issue’ button) that allows users to:

- Create a workspace without selecting an issue first
- Optionally provide a name/description for the workspace
- Select TTL and agent

### 2. Update EditorSelector Component

Modify `EditorSelector.tsx` to support standalone mode:

- Add a prop to indicate standalone vs issue-based workspace
- Handle the case where no issue context is provided

### 3. Workspace List Updates

Update the workspace list view to:

- Show standalone workspaces with a distinct indicator
- Display the workspace name/description instead of issue title
- Allow filtering by workspace type (standalone vs issue-based)

### 4. New Standalone Workspace Modal

Create a modal for standalone workspace creation with fields:

- Workspace name (optional)
- Description/goal for the AI (optional)
- TTL selection
- Agent selection
- Editor choice (VS Code / Terminal)

## Tasks

1. Create `StandaloneWorkspaceModal.tsx` component
1. Update `EditorSelector.tsx` to handle standalone mode
1. Add gRPC client call to `OpenStandaloneWorkspace` RPC
1. Update workspace list components to show standalone workspaces
1. Add ‘New Workspace’ action to project view
