# Make Daemon Not Connected Dialog Mobile-Friendly

## Overview

The DaemonDisconnectedOverlay component needs to be made responsive for mobile devices.

## Current Issues

- Fixed 48px padding is too large on mobile screens
- 480px max-width may exceed narrow device widths
- 64x64px icon is too large for mobile
- Buttons may not have adequate touch targets (44px minimum)
- Font sizes not optimized for small screens

## Files to Modify

- `components/layout/DaemonDisconnectedOverlay.tsx`
- `styles/components/DaemonDisconnectedOverlay.css`

## Implementation Tasks

- [ ] Add responsive padding (reduce on mobile)
- [ ] Make max-width adaptive for narrow screens
- [ ] Scale down icon size on mobile viewports
- [ ] Ensure buttons meet 44px minimum touch target
- [ ] Adjust font sizes for mobile readability
- [ ] Add media queries for mobile breakpoints

## Screenshot Testing

- [ ] Add visual tests in `e2e/tests/visual/` for the overlay
- [ ] Test mobile viewport (375x667) following existing patterns
- [ ] Test tablet viewport (768x1024)
- [ ] Verify overlay renders correctly in demo mode (daemon disconnected state)
